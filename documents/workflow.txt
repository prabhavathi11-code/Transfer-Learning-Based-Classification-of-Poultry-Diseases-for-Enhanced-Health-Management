ðŸ”¹ Activity 1: Specify the Poultry Disease Classification Objective
Objective:
Identify visual and biological features related to major poultry diseases and define a strategy to classify them accurately using image-based data.

Work Done:

Conducted background research on poultry diseases like Coccidiosis, Newcastle Disease, Salmonella, and Healthy conditions.

Identified visible symptoms and environmental factors (e.g., feather discoloration, lesions, posture changes) relevant for classification.

Selected and prepared an image dataset from Roboflow containing labeled samples for each disease category.

Preprocessed the dataset by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images to improve model robustness.

Outcome:

Established a feature-rich dataset with visually distinct categories of poultry conditions.

Created the foundation for training a deep learning model using transfer learning for high-accuracy disease prediction.

Highlighted the importance of accessible, tech-driven solutions in rural poultry health management.
